# ADK Geo Frontend

Goal:
This project provides a one-command-launch frontend for exploring geospatial data using ADK agents. It’s built for anyone – from curious beginners to researchers – who wants a simple, interactive UI (map + chat + info) without having to set up a full stack from scratch.

Framework:

    Frontend: Streamlit (Map + Chat + Info Panel)

    Backend: FastAPI serving an ADK agent

    Deployment: Docker Compose (no local setup needed)

Just clone the repo, run one command, and start exploring geospatial datasets using natural language.
